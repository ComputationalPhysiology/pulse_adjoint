# Pulse-Adjoint

Pulse-Adjoint is an extension of the [pulse](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/pulse) library for doing data assimilation for cardiac mechanics applications.


## Note
This is a full rewriting of the code in the [following repo](https://github.com/ComputationalPhysiology/pulse_adjoint). Note that the version in this repo is experimental an might contains several bugs. If you encounter bugs we would appreciate if you could file an issue.
